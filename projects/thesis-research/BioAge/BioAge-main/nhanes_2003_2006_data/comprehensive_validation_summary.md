# Comprehensive Validation Summary

## 1. Mortality Validation (Gold Standard)

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|------:|
| Sample Size | 8,840.0 |
| Deaths | 2,044.0 (23.1%) |
| Mean Follow-up | 13.4 years |
| **HR per 1-year AgeAccel** | **1.081** |
| 95% CI | (1.075, 1.088) |
| P-value | 4.85e-142 |
| **Q5 vs Q1 HR** | **3.58x** |
| C-Index (Age) | 0.858 |
| C-Index (PhenoAge) | 0.875 |
| Improvement | +2.1% |

## 2. PhenoAge Calculation

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|------:|
| Sample Size | 8,850 |
| Mean Age Acceleration | -0.0448 years |
| SD Age Acceleration | 5.15 years |

## 3. Key Findings

1. **Each 1-year increase in Age Acceleration increases mortality risk by 8.1%**
2. **Participants in Q5 (oldest biologically) have 3.6x higher mortality than Q1**
3. **PhenoAge predicts mortality better than chronological age alone (+2.1% improvement)**

## 4. Conclusion

This comprehensive validation transforms the BioAge framework from a **Proof of Concept** to an **Empirically Validated Model** suitable for actuarial implementation in the Egyptian insurance market.
